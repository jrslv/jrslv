Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜Š

I'm the founder of [Rejobs.org](https://rejobs.org/en), the renewable energy job board.

For over 10 years, I've been shipping production systems with:

- Go, PHP, Python
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, TimescaleDB
- Docker, K8s, Terraform
- AWS, GCP, and bare metal
- and a lot more...

Mainly in these areas:

- Designing and building secure web services and APIs for great user experience and reliability
- Transforming legacy systems into modern, maintainable architectures
- Building data pipelines for analytics and monitoring systems
- Integration of LLMs into production applications

Notable projects:

- [Rejobs.org](https://rejobs.org/en) - Renewable energy job board connecting talent with climate tech companies
- [Binocs](https://github.com/automato-io/binocs-cli) - CLI-first synthetic monitoring tool with Go client binaries, Terraform provider, and REST API (discontinued)
