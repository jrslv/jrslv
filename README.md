Hi there üëã üòä

I'm the founder of [Rejobs.org](https://rejobs.org/en), the renewable energy job board. I build climate tech solutions.

For over 10 years, I've been shipping production systems with Go, PHP, Python | PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, MongoDB | Docker, K8s, Terraform | AWS, GCP, and bare metal.

**What I do:**

- Design APIs and microservices for real-time time-series data processing
- Transform legacy systems into modern, maintainable architectures
- Build data pipelines for analytics and monitoring systems
- Integrate LLMs into production applications

**Notable projects:**

- **Rejobs.org** - Renewable energy job board connecting talent with climate tech companies
- **Binocs** - CLI-first synthetic monitoring tool with Go client binaries, Terraform provider, and REST API (discontinued)

üîç I'm open to opportunities where I can use my tech skills to accelerate the energy transition. Contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jholub/) or [jholub@gmail.com](mailto:jholub@gmail.com)
